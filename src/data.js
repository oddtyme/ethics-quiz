	text: "Imagine that the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency gets wind of a plot to set off a dirty bomb in a major American city. Agents capture a suspect who, they believe, has information about where the bomb is planted. Is it permissible for them to torture the suspect into revealing the bomb's whereabouts",
	answers: ['Yes (Utilitarian)', 'No', 'Yes, but on the condition that the torture is not fatal', 'Yes, if the majority agrees', 'Yes, if the number of people killed whom the bomb would kill exceeds the number of people whom the torture would kill',  "No, because there isn't enough proof that the man is responsible", 'No, because nothing condemns the man besides rumor', 'Maybe, it depends on the number of people the bomb would harm']
}];
