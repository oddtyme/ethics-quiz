	text: "Suppose that the National Football League institutes a rule that any active player should not be allowed to consume CBD oil or other forms of cannabis, and that any consumption will result in a year-long ban and a hefty, 6-figure fine. If the US government legalizes the usage of all forms of cannabis to all US citizens over 18, is the NFLâ€™s policy on cannabis usage ethical?",
	answers: ['Yes', 'No', 'Yes, the players work for the NFL, not the government', 'Yes, the NFL is looking out for players, and nothing more', 'Yes, if the NFL determines through any means that those who consume CBD get some advantage', 'Yes, since other jobs require drug tests (retail, fast food)', 'No, the decision to use cannabis should not be determined by anyone but the self', 'No, if it is proven that enough people use cannabis in the NFL already', 'No, the NFL does not take priority over the law']
